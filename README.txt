> Update 2020: The radio24syv API is no more. As such, this script is no longer useful. I hope you got the podcasts you wanted. Otherwise see https://podimo.com/dk/shows/96ddbb42-56b1-4c6a-9676-9c4c4651f706.

This is a node script that can fetch the URLs of a Radio24syv podcast.
It'll save the URLs to a "urls.txt" file. From there it's up to you!

> Lavet saa alle kan lytte til https://www.24syv.dk/programmer/croque-monsieur, altid.
